# machineLearningFun
Having fun while learning machine learning. Learning algorithms and understanding the math and intuition behind while solving
ML problems with data using jupyter notebooks. I will use exisiting libraries (scikit-learn, tensorflow and others) while understanding the concepts and algorithms,
however later I will implement the algorithms from scratch.
